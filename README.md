## Introduction

Consistency models define the rules about when and how updates to a distributed system become visible to different parts of the system. Think of consistency models as "rules of engagement" for how multiple processes can interact with shared data in a distributed system.

**Simple Analogy**: Imagine a shared whiteboard in a classroom where multiple students can write. Consistency models are like different sets of rules:
- **Strong rules**: Only one student can write at a time, everyone sees changes immediately
- **Weak rules**: Multiple students can write simultaneously, but there might be delays in seeing each other's changes

## Fundamental Concepts

### Systems and State
A distributed system has a **logical state** that changes over time. For example:
- A simple counter: states like `0`, `5`, `42`
- A key-value store: states like `{user: "Alice", score: 100}`

### Processes
A **process** is a single-threaded program that performs operations. Think of it as one person using the system at a time.

### Operations
An **operation** changes the system from one state to another:
- `read(x)` → returns current value of x
- `write(x, 5)` → sets x to 5
- `increment(counter)` → adds 1 to counter

### Concurrency and Time
Operations have:
- **Invocation time**: when the operation starts
- **Completion time**: when the operation finishes
- **Concurrent operations**: operations that overlap in time

**Analogy**: Like phone calls - you dial (invoke), talk (execute), and hang up (complete). Two calls are concurrent if they overlap in time.

## Strong Consistency Models

### 1. Strict Serializable

**Definition**: The strongest consistency model that combines serializability (for transactions) with linearizability (for real-time ordering).

**Simple Analogy**: 
Like a high-security bank vault where:
- Complex transactions (moving money between accounts) happen atomically
- Everything happens in real-time order
- No two operations can interfere with each other

**Key Properties**:
- Transactions appear to execute in some serial order
- Real-time ordering is preserved
- Strongest possible guarantee
- Not available in asynchronous networks

**Example**:
```
Timeline: T1: transfer($100, A→B) -------- T2: read(A), read(B)

Strict Serializable guarantees:
- T2 sees either the state before T1 or after T1, never a partial state
- If T1 completes before T2 starts, T2 must see T1's effects
```

### 2. Linearizable (Atomic Consistency)

**Definition**: Every operation appears to take effect atomically at some point between its start and completion, respecting real-time ordering.

**Simple Analogy**: 
A single-window bank teller serving customers one at a time. No matter how many people are in line, each transaction happens completely before the next one starts, and everyone sees the same account balance.

**Key Properties**:
- Operations appear instantaneous
- Real-time ordering preserved
- All processes see the same order
- Applies to single objects

**Example**:
```
Process A: write(x, 1) [starts at t1, ends at t2]
Process B: read(x) [starts at t3, ends at t4] where t2 < t3

Linearizable outcome: B must read x=1
```

### 3. Sequential Consistency

**Definition**: All operations appear to execute in some sequential order, and each process sees operations in the same order, but real-time ordering is not required.

**Simple Analogy**:
Like a group chat where everyone receives messages in the same order, but the order might not match exactly when messages were sent due to network delays.

**Key Properties**:
- Global ordering exists
- All processes see same order
- Real-time ordering not required
- Weaker than linearizability

**Example**:
```
Real-time: A writes x=1, then B writes x=2
Sequential consistent outcomes:
- All nodes see: x=1, then x=2 (respects real-time) ✓
- All nodes see: x=2, then x=1 (violates real-time but still valid) ✓
```

## Transaction-Based Models

### 4. Serializable

**Definition**: Transactions appear to execute in some serial order, but real-time ordering is not required.

**Simple Analogy**:
Like a restaurant kitchen where complex orders are prepared, but they might be completed in a different order than they were received, as long as each complete meal is served properly.

**Key Properties**:
- Transactions appear atomic
- Some serial execution order exists
- No real-time constraints
- Prevents anomalies like dirty reads, phantom reads

### 5. Snapshot Isolation

**Definition**: Each transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the database as of the time it started.

**Simple Analogy**:
Like taking a photograph of a busy street. Your photo shows a consistent moment in time, even though the street continues to change while you're looking at the photo.

**Key Properties**:
- Transactions see consistent snapshots
- No dirty reads or non-repeatable reads
- Write-write conflicts are prevented
- May allow write skew anomalies

**Example**:
```
T1 starts, sees snapshot: {A: 100, B: 200}
T2 starts, sees same snapshot: {A: 100, B: 200}
T1 writes A=150, commits
T2 writes B=250, commits
Final state: {A: 150, B: 250}
```

### 6. Repeatable Read

**Definition**: Within a transaction, reading the same data multiple times returns the same result.

**Simple Analogy**:
Like reading a book where the pages don't change while you're reading it, even if someone else might be editing other copies of the book.

**Key Properties**:
- No dirty reads
- No non-repeatable reads
- May allow phantom reads
- Weaker than serializable

### 7. Read Committed

**Definition**: Transactions only see data that has been committed by other transactions.

**Simple Analogy**:
Like only reading published articles in a newspaper, never seeing the rough drafts that reporters are still working on.

**Key Properties**:
- No dirty reads
- Allows non-repeatable reads
- Allows phantom reads
- Most common isolation level

### 8. Read Uncommitted

**Definition**: Transactions can see uncommitted changes from other transactions.

**Simple Analogy**:
Like being able to peek at someone's rough draft while they're still writing it - you might see changes that get erased later.

**Key Properties**:
- Allows dirty reads
- Weakest transaction isolation
- Highest performance, lowest consistency

## Single-Object Models

### 9. Causal Consistency

**Definition**: Operations that are causally related must be seen in the same order by all processes, but concurrent operations can be seen in different orders.

**Simple Analogy**:
Like a conversation thread on social media. Everyone must see replies after the original post they're responding to, but if two people comment simultaneously, different users might see those comments in different orders.

**Key Properties**:
- Preserves cause-and-effect relationships
- Concurrent operations can be reordered
- Respects "happens-before" relationships
- Weaker than sequential consistency

**Example**:
```
Process A: write(x, 1), then write(y, 2) [causally related]
Process B: write(z, 3) [concurrent with A's operations]

Causal consistency requires:
- All nodes see x=1 before y=2
- z=3 can appear anywhere in the sequence
```

### 10. PRAM Consistency (Pipeline RAM)

**Definition**: Each process sees its own operations in the order it issued them, but operations from different processes can be seen in any order.

**Simple Analogy**:
Like personal diaries that get shared. You always write in your diary in chronological order, and when others read your diary, they see your entries in sequence. But when multiple diaries are combined, entries from different people can be mixed in any order.

**Key Properties**:
- Per-process ordering preserved
- No global ordering requirement
- Operations from different processes can be arbitrarily interleaved

**Example**:
```
Process A: write(x, 1), write(x, 2), write(x, 3)
Process B: write(y, 1), write(y, 2)

PRAM guarantees:
- All nodes see A's writes in order: x=1, x=2, x=3
- All nodes see B's writes in order: y=1, y=2
- But A's and B's operations can be interleaved differently on different nodes
```

## Session Guarantees

### 11. Monotonic Reads

**Definition**: If a process reads a value, any subsequent reads by that process will return the same value or a more recent value.

**Simple Analogy**:
Like reading a book - once you've read up to page 50, you'll never accidentally flip back and read page 30 thinking it's new content. You can only move forward or stay at the same page.

**Example**:
```
Process reads x=5 at time T1
Later reads at T2, T3, T4 return x=5, x=7, x=7 (never x=3)
```

### 12. Monotonic Writes

**Definition**: Writes by a single process are seen by all processes in the order they were issued.

**Simple Analogy**:
Like sending numbered letters to friends. Even if the postal system is unreliable, your friends will receive letter #1 before letter #2, and letter #2 before letter #3.

### 13. Read Your Writes

**Definition**: A process always sees the effects of its own previous writes.

**Simple Analogy**:
Like writing a note and being able to read what you just wrote. You never experience amnesia about your own actions.

**Example**:
```
Process writes x=10
Process immediately reads x → must return 10 (or newer value)
```

### 14. Writes Follow Reads

**Definition**: If a process reads a value and then writes, the write is guaranteed to take place on a copy that is at least as recent as the one where the read took place.

**Simple Analogy**:
Like editing a document - if you read version 5 of a document and then make changes, your changes are applied to version 5 or later, never to an older version.

## Model Relationships and Implications

### Implication Chain
When we say model A "implies" model B, it means every history that satisfies A also satisfies B. A is "stronger" than B.

```
Strict Serializable → Serializable → Repeatable Read → Read Committed → Read Uncommitted
                   → Linearizable → Sequential → Causal → PRAM → Monotonic Reads/Writes
```

### Key Relationships

1. **Strict Serializable** is the strongest model, implying both:
   - Serializable (for transactions)
   - Linearizable (for real-time ordering)

2. **Sequential Consistency** is implied by linearizability but doesn't require real-time ordering

3. **Causal Consistency** preserves causality but allows concurrent operations to be reordered

4. **Session Guarantees** (Monotonic Reads/Writes, Read Your Writes) provide per-process consistency

---

## Availability Trade-offs

### CAP Theorem Context
The stronger the consistency model, the less available the system can be during network partitions.

**Availability Classifications**:
- **Not Available**: Strict Serializable, Linearizable, Sequential
- **Sticky Available**: Read Your Writes, Monotonic Reads/Writes
- **Totally Available**: Eventual Consistency, some weak models

**Simple Analogy**:
Think of consistency vs. availability like accuracy vs. speed in journalism:
- **High Consistency**: Like a newspaper that fact-checks everything (slow but accurate)
- **High Availability**: Like social media news (fast but potentially inconsistent)

---

## Real-World Applications

### When to Use Each Model

**Strict Serializable**:
- Financial systems (bank transfers)
- Inventory management
- Any system where correctness is critical

**Linearizable**:
- Configuration systems
- Leader election
- Coordination services (like Zookeeper)

**Sequential Consistency**:
- Distributed caches
- Replicated state machines
- Systems where global ordering matters but real-time doesn't

**Causal Consistency**:
- Social media feeds
- Collaborative editing
- Chat systems

**Eventual Consistency**:
- DNS systems
- Content delivery networks
- Shopping cart systems

## Summary

Consistency models form a hierarchy from strongest (Strict Serializable) to weakest (Eventual Consistency). The choice of consistency model involves trade-offs:

- **Stronger models** provide better guarantees but limit availability and performance
- **Weaker models** offer better availability and performance but fewer guarantees

Understanding these models helps you choose the right consistency level for your application's needs, balancing correctness requirements with performance and availability constraints.

The key insight is that different parts of your system might need different consistency models - you don't need to apply the same model everywhere. A shopping cart might use eventual consistency, while payment processing requires strict serializability.
